I have been using Windows for PHP and JavaScript development for a few years now. I usually have two Linuxes on my computer. One with PHP 7 and PHP 8. I like that when I totally mess up a Linux, I can delete it and rebuild it. I also like

This post is about setup for PHP7 web development for Windows. This is Linux is mainly used for WordPress development. I have a [similar post](https://joshpress.net/blog/wsl-debian-php8) about setting up the PHP 8 linux. In this post I will show what I do __after__ setting up WSL2 for PHP and JavaScript development. In this post I will show what I do __after__ setting up WSL2 for PHP and JavaScript development.

If you do not have WSL2 installed, please checkout my post about [installing Windows Linux Subsystem](/blog/install-wsl).


## Install Ubuntu

First you will need a Ubuntu. Open the Windows start menu and type "Ubuntu 20.04 LTS". You should see an option to install through the Microsoft store.

Once Ubunutu is installed, open it up and set a root username and password. This is a good time to setup SSH and git credential managment, which I [explained at the end of this post](/install-wsl).

## Install Node

I found that [installing Node with NVM](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-node-js-on-ubuntu-20-04) works the best. NVM allows switching node versions, which is cool. I had issues using Node, when isntalled with `apt-get install node` and never when doing it this way:

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.35.3/install.sh | bash
source ~/.bashrc
nvm install 14
npm install --global yarn
```

This installs Node 14. That includes npm. It also using npm, to install Yarn.

Test it with:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
yarn -v

```

## Install PHP 7.4

As of when I wrote this, `sudo apt install php-cli` installs PHP7, not PHP8. That may change. For now, you can install PHP 7.4 with:

```bash
sudo apt install php-cli
```
Then you can install the PHP extensions with:

```bash
sudo apt install php7.4-{mysql,cli,common,imap,ldap,xml,fpm,curl,mbstring,zip}
```

You can add or remove extensions from that list, based on your needs.

Test it with:

```bash
php -v
```

### Install composer

Don't forget the PHP package manager [Composer](https://getcomposer.org)

```bash
sudo php composer-setup.php --install-dir=/usr/local/bin --filename=composer
wget -O composer-setup.php https://getcomposer.org/installer

```
Test it with:

```bash
composer -v
```


## Now Code

That's all I do. From there, I can clone a project, switch to that directory, type `code .` and VSCode opens up. I get the same VSCode settings and keybindings as in Windows. The only difference is the terminal is bash and everything runs in Ubuntu.
