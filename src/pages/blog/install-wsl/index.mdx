I have been using Windows for PHP and JavaScript development for a few years now. At first, I used gitbash as my shell and since I was running most things in Docker, it worked well. Once Docker fully supported WSL2, I switched to doing development in Linux, on Windows. Docker on Windows is already way faster than a Mac.


## Install Windows Linux Subsystem for Local WordPress Development on Windows

In some cases, this is as simple as running `wsl --install` in PowerShell. Make sure to start PowerShell with administrator privileges. I had to do most of the manual installation steps:

```powershell
dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart
dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:VirtualMachinePlatform /all /norestart
```

Then I downloaded and installed [this msi](https://wslstorestorage.blob.core.windows.net/wslblob/wsl_update_x64.msi). Then I set version two of WSL, again from PowerShell with administrator privileges:

```powershell
wsl --set-default-version 2
```

I figured this out by reading these links:

- [Install WSL2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10)
  - `wsl` command works for me in gitbash, but not powershell. I don't know why.
- [Docker With WSL2](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/wsl/)
- [Set default distro](https://winaero.com/set-default-wsl-linux-distro-windows-10/)

## Configure For PHP and JavaScript Development


That's how I get started. From there, I create two Linuxes, I wrote posts about both of them:

- [PHP7 and JavaScript development with WSL2](blog/wsl-ubuntu-php7)
- [PHP8 and JavaScript development with WSL2](blog/wsl-debian-php8)


## Setup Git and SSH

Before this setup can be complete, you need to be able to use SSH. Otherwise, you can't do git push to Github.

You could create a new key for this Linux. I prefer to copy keys from the host machine.

First setup your git profile, with something like:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Roy Sivan"
git config --global user.email "hi@hiroy.club"
git config --global core.autocrlf false
git config --global credential.helper "/mnt/c/Program\ Files/Git/mingw64/libexec/git-core/git-credential-manager.exe"
```

That line tells git to use Windows' credential manger. Then you can copy the keys from Windows to Ubuntu. Make sure to change "roy" to your Windows username:

``bash
mkdir ~/.ssh
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa
cd ~/.ssh
cp /mnt/c/Users/roy/.ssh/id_rsa* .
```

I figured this out by reading these links:
