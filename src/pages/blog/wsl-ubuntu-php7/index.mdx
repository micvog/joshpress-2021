I have been using Windows for PHP and JavaScript development for a few years now. I usually have two Linuxes on my computer. One with PHP 7 and PHP 8. I like that when I totally mess up a Linux, I can delete it and rebuild it. I also like

This post is about setup for PHP7 web development for Windows. In this post I will show what I do __after__ setting up WSL2 for PHP and JavaScript development.

If you do not have WSL2 installed, please take a look at these links first:

- [Install WSL2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10)
  - `wsl` command works for me in gitbash, but not powershell. I don't know why.
- [Docker With WSL2](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/wsl/)
- [Set default distro](https://winaero.com/set-default-wsl-linux-distro-windows-10/)

## Install Ubuntu

First you will need a Ubuntu. Open the Windows start menu and type "Ubuntu 20.04 LTS". You should see an option to install through the Microsoft store.

Once Ubunutu is installed, open it up and set a root username and password.

## Install Node

I found that [installing Node with NVM](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-node-js-on-ubuntu-20-04) works the best. NVM allows switching node versions, which is cool. I had issues using Node, when isntalled with `apt-get install node` and never when doing it this way:

```sh
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.35.3/install.sh | bash
source ~/.bashrc
nvm install lts/erbium
npm install --global yarn
```

This installs the LTS version of Node. That includes npm. It also using npm, to install Yarn.

Test it with:

```sh
node -v
npm -v
yarn -v

```

## Install PHP 7.4

As of when I wrote this, `sudo apt install php-cli` installs PHP7, not PHP8. That may change. For now, you can install PHP 7.4 with:

```sh
sudo apt install php-cli

Then you can install the PHP extensions with:

```
sudo apt install php7.4-{mysql,cli,common,imap,ldap,xml,fpm,curl,mbstring,zip}

```

You can add or remove extensions from that list, based on your needs.

Test it with:

```sh
php -v
```

### Install composer

Don't forget the PHP package manager [Composer](https://getcomposer.org)

```sh
sudo php composer-setup.php --install-dir=/usr/local/bin --filename=composer
wget -O composer-setup.php https://getcomposer.org/installer

```
Test it with:

```sh
composer -v
```

## Setup Git and SSH

Before this setup can be complete, you need to be able to use SSH. Otherwise, you can't do git push to Github.

You could create a new key for this Linux. I prefer to copy keys from the host machine.

First setup your git profile, with something like:

```sh
git config --global user.name "Roy Sivan"
git config --global user.email "hi@hiroy.club"
git config --global core.autocrlf false
git config --global credential.helper "/mnt/c/Program\ Files/Git/mingw64/libexec/git-core/git-credential-manager.exe"
```

That line tells git to use Windows' credential manger. Then you can copy the keys from Windows to Ubuntu. Make sure to change "roy" to your Windows username:

```sh
mkdir ~/.ssh
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa
cd ~/.ssh
cp /mnt/c/Users/roy/.ssh/id_rsa* .
```

I figured this out by reading these links:

- https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/wsl-git
- https://peteoshea.co.uk/setup-git-in-wsl/

## Now Code

That's all I do. From there, I can clone a project, switch to that directory, type `code .` and VSCode opens up. I get the same VSCode settings and keybindings as in Windows. The only difference is the terminal is bash and everything runs in Ubuntu.
